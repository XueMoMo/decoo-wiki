# Retrieving Files

This is a brief tutorial on how to retrieve files from IPFS.

## Basics

As IPFS is an open and distributed network for storing files, you can always retrieve (access or/and download) your files which have been already pinned to IPFS.

Fundamentally, there are two ways to retrieve your files form IPFS--**Using a public IPFS gateway**, or **building an IPFS gateway yourself**.

## What is an IPFS gateway?

A gateway is basically a device that bridging two networks. An IPFS gateway, to this definition, constructs bridges between IPFS network and the world outside. 

For example, as many popular browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) cannot natively support IPFS, a gateway is needed that helps you access the IPFS network from your browser (via HTTP).

If you want to know more about IPFS gateway, please refer to [this page](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#overview) from IPFS Docs.

## Retrieve files from a Public Gateway

You can retrieve files from a public gateway, totally free of charge. There are dozens of public gateways available worldwide, and of course their performance varies because they are not paid services.

Check the IPFS's official [gateway checker](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/) and get a full list of available registered public gateways. The list is sorted by the real-time latency with the lowerest on the top. The latency may be affected by the provider's capability, location, current throughput, and other factors. 

Decoo also provides a [Decoo public gateway](https://ipfs.decoo.io) and you can find it on gateway checker. Remember, you can resort to any public gateway to do the retrieving as long as it is available, whatever pinning service you use.
