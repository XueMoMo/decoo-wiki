Business data produced by all *Endpoints* will be synced to *Decoo Cloud*.

## Endpoint

Deployed in IDC data centers, and provides dedicated *file upload* functionality. Decoo will continuously build more and more *Endpoints*. Users could choose *Endpoint* to upload files based on their conditions like geographic position, network connectivity, etc.
