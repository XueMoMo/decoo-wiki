## Endpoint
https://api.decoo.io/pinning/pinFile

## Description
Upload and pin a file to Decoo's Ipfs nodes, which will also eventually be stored to Crust network.

## Type
POST

## Headers
```
"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## Body
The body of this request needs to take the form of a multipart/form-data with the following key / values:

**file**<br/>
The first key in the form-data body should be named "file", and the value should be the file you're attempting to upload to Decoo.

**decooOptions (Optional)**

You can pass some additional options to control how your content is pinned to Decoo.

- *cidVersion*: The IPFS CID version used when creating a hash for your content. Valid options are:
  - *"0"*: CID v0
  - *"1"*: CID v1

  The default value is *"0"*.

- *wrapWithDirectory*: Whether to wrap your content inside of a directory when adding to IPFS. This allows users to retrieve content via a filename instead of a hash. Valid options are:
  - *true*
  - *false*

  The default value is *false*.

An example *decooOptions* is like below:
```json
"decooOptions": {
  "cidVersion": "0",
  "wrapWithDirectory": true
}
```

  
**decooMetadata (Optional)**

You can also include some metadata when pinning content to Decoo cloud. The metadata can later be used for easy querying on what you've pinned with [pinList](pinning/pin-list.md) request.

*decooMetadata* takes following form:
```json
{
  "name": "<A custom name. If not provided, the original name of the content (if feasible) will be used.>"
}
```

An example *decooMetadata* is like below:
```json
"decooOptions": {
  "name": "My File"
}
```

## Response
```json
{
  "PinHash": "<This is the Ipfs multi-hash provided back for your file>",
  "PinSize": "<This is the size (in bytes) of the pinned content>",
  "PinDate": "<This is the timestamp for your content pinning (represented in ISO 8601 format)>"
}
```

## Curl Example
```sh
curl -X POST "https://api.decoo.io/pinning/pinFile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F file=<YOUR_FILE>
  --data '{"decooOptions": {"cidVersion": 0, "wrapWithDirectory": true}, "decooMetadata": {"name": "My File"}}'
```
